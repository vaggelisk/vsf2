# More info about the project

## Magento Admin Panel (magentoAdminPanel)

Our project _VSF_ is a front-end app of the  back-end platform _Magento_,
which has its own  code (php).

It has also an Admin Panel (let's always write it _magentoAdminPanel_), where
sellers can add their products, see their orders and much more. Also devs
can configure some stuff which is necessary for VSF running.

You can visit our magentoAdminPanel from [here](https://evia.pyconero.gr/admin_w896gj/).
