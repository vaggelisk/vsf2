## Just another try to live differently from what our repressors are planning for us

-----------

## For Deploying this Documentation

After push your changes to the remote branch,
you login to the server and mount the <project_folder> and you type

> npx vuepress build docs

There is an occasion you should type also

> sudo systemctl restart nginx

But for sure you have to open https://docs.evia.pyconero.gr/
on a new private browser, cause cache has to clean

## For Deploying of the App

For Deploying of the App in the Dev Server look the local file
`READMEforDeploying.md`
